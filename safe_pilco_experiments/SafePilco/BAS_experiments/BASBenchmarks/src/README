Contents of folder:

1. All Parameters used by benchmark: BASParameters.m

2. Models of the individual BAS Components labelled as XXModel.m where "XX" corresponds to the respective component

3. File to setup and simulate the whole BAS set-up being considered (cf. Fig 1 in paper): WholeBAS_setup.m

4. Files to instantiate and simulate the models presented in Case Study 1:
   (i)  CaseStudy1_Md.m : Deterministic model 
   (ii) CaseStudy1_Mda.m: Deterministic model with additive noise
   (iii)CaseStudy1_Ms.m : Stochastic model

5. Files describing models presented in Case Study 2 with option to simulate model over given time horizon:
   (i)  CaseStudy2_Mc.m  : Model with large number of continuous variables (dimension 7)
   (ii) CaseStudy2_Mc4.m : Abstract model (dimension 4)
   (iii)CaseStudy2_Mc3.m : Abstract model (dimension 3)
   (iv) CaseStudy2_Mc2.m : Abstract model (dimension 2)
   (v)  CaseStudy2_Mc1.m : Abstract model (dimension 1)

6. File describing hyrbid model in Case Study 3: CaseStudy3_Hybrid.xml (In xml format to allow for direct loading into SpaceEx)

7. Core file: createModel.m: Used by all model files. It is a class file which,
  (i) initialises the models based on their underlying structure and input system matrices;
  (ii) converts the models into symbolic models
  (iii) allows to simulate the models
  (iv) provides option to perform a step response of the underlying model (for analysis)
8. Auxiliary file: PlotFigures.m: plots simulation output over specified time horizon
